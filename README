# clj-xmemcached

An opensource memcached client for clojure wrapping xmemcached. Xmemcached is an opensource high performance memcached client for java.

## Usage

### Create a client

    (use [clj-xmemcached.core])
	(def client (xmemcached "host1:port1 host2:port2" :protocol binary))

Then we create a memcached client using binary protocol to talk with memcached servers host1:port1 and host2:port2.
Valid options including:

	  :name  Client's name
	  :protocol  Protocol to talk with memcached,a string value in text,binary or kestrel,default is text protocol.
	  :hash  Hash algorithm,a string value in consistent or standard,default is standard hash.
	  :pool  Connection pool size,default is one.

### Store items

	(xset client "key" "dennis")
	(xset client "key" "dennis" 100)
	(xappend client "key" " zhuang")
	(xprepend client "key" "hello,")

The value 100 is the expire time for the item.Store functions include xset,xadd,xreplace,xappend and xprepend.Please use doc to print documentation for these functions.

### Get items

	(xget client "key")
	(xgets client "key")

xgets returns a value including a cas value.

### Increase/Decrease

	(xincr client "num" 1)
	(xdecr client "num" 1)
	(xincr client "num" 1 0)

Above codes try to increase/decrease a number in memcached with key "num",and if the item is not exists,then set it to zero.

### Compare and set

	(xcas client "key" inc)

We use inc function to increase the current value in memcached and try to compare and set it at most Integer.MAX_VALUE times.
xcas can be called as:

   (xcas client key cas-fn max-times)

The cas-fn is a function to return a new value,set the new value to 

	(cas-fn current-value)

### Shutdown

	(xshutdown client)

### Flush

	(xflush client)
	(xflush client (InetSocketAddress. host port))

### Statistics

	(xstats client)

### Example

Please see the example code in example/demo.clj
